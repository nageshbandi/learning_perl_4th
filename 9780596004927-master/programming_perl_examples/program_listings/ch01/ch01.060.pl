0          # would become the string "0", so false.
1          # would become the string "1", so true.
10 - 10    # 10 minus 10 is 0, would convert to string "0", so false.
0.00       # equals 0, would convert to string "0", so false.
"0"        # is the string "0", so false.
""         # is a null string, so false.
"0.00"     # is the string "0.00", neither "" nor "0", so true!
"0.00" + 0 # would become the number 0 (coerced by the +), so false.
\$a        # is a reference to $a, so true, even if $a is false.
undef()    # is a function returning the undefined value, so false.
